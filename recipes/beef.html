        What's more Irish than a traditional recipe for corned beef and cabbage? 
        Serve with mustard or horseradish if desired.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>

            Cover pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. 
            Simmer approximately 50 minutes per pound or until tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add whole potatoes and carrots, 
            and cook until the vegetables are almost tender. 
            Add cabbage and cook for 15 more minutes.
